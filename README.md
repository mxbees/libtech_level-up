Hey. So this book/tutorial/workshop was originally inspired by [a blog post by nina on a personal vision for levelling up tech skills][1]. Then [twitter @flexlibris][2] asked me if I wanted to, um, actually flesh out a proper workshop. And _then_ while I was tweeting about the resources I was going to be referring to, [@ruthtillman][3] asked me if I wanted to collaborate on actually putting together a proper book/tutorial. And I did!

Thus, we have the "Libtech Level Up" project.
