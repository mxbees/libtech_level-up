# Do I Have To Use The Command Line To Use git?
At the risk of expressing an unpopular opinion, I'm going to say **no**. 

That's not to say you should be afraid of the command line, or that you should avoid it at all costs. However, I think the command line makes sense for a certain subset of people -- usually developers -- who are familiar with Linux or other *nix operating systems who think GUIs are slow and inherently inferior. 

I'm not one of those people. 

[Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)[^1], the creator of Linux and git once said that he "[didn't really expect anyone to use (git) because it's so hard to use.](http://typicalprogrammer.com/linus-torvalds-goes-off-on-linux-and-git/)" 

> Git has taken over where Linux left off separating the geeks into know-nothings and know-it-alls... that turns out to be its big appeal. No technology can ever be too arcane or complicated for the black t-shirt crowd.

If the creator of the system thinks it's too hard to use, you shouldn't feel bad if you're struggling with wrapping your brain around all of this command line stuff. 

I've worked with the command line in some form since 1993. But I still find it nearly impossible to remember git commands, and when that happens, I usually mess something up and merge something that shouldn't be merged. It's times like this that I turn to GUI-based git clients, but even they're not without their drawbacks. 

[^1]: Linus Torvalds is known as [a bit of a jerk](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/126049-Linux-Namesake-Argues-In-Favor-Of-Being-A-Jerk) so including his words here makes me feel more than a little creepy. Still, if the guy who created git thinks it's hard to use, I think there might be some merit to his words just this once.
