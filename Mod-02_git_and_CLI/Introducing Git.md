# Introducing Version Control

## What is Version Control?
**Version control** allows you to track changes in a project over time. You've probably set up a system on your computer that has many different folders or versions of documents, each with complex naming conventions like `file_v1`, `file_v2`, `file_final`, and the like. What if there was a system that could make keeping track of all the versions of your work much easier?

Well, that's what version control does. Version control acts like a database that takes snapshots of your document or complete project anytime you like. The version control system records the changes to your project’s files. 

Version control also stores metadata about your project, such as the author name, any comments you might add to note modifications to your project.

Version control allows you to work with any kind of document you like; plain text files, spreadsheets, images, sound files — whatever the tool, you can use version control to save previous versions of your work. And even though it isn’t the primary focus of the system, version control also provides a local backup of your project. 

### Distributed Version Control
Some version control systems are *centralized*, which means there is one single master copy of your project, and you check in/check out files from this master copy. Git is not like that. 

Git is a *distributed* version control system. A full copy of your project can exist in many different locations, such as on your workstation, your personal laptop, or on a web server that serves your library’s website. 

The best thing about distributed systems is you don’t have to check them out from a centralized location. You can keep a copy of your entire project on as many computers as you need and work on those files for as long as you want. If by some unlikely chance the distributed location fails, you will always have a local copy of the files on your system, so you can worry less about losing your work.
