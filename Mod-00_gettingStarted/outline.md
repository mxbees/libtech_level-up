#Introduction to *nix

##How this is all going to go down...

I'm kind of a reasonably big fan of self-directed learning but with guidance... Things we'll be doing:

1. General introduction to *nix and related topics
2. Get set up.
3. Work though "learning the cli the hardway tutorial"

This is really all. You might be wondering "omg, why are we here for 4 hours if this is all we are doing?". Well... because unlike a lot of workshops I've attended we are going get everyone set up for doing the work. This will take a little time because there are always little hiccups... 

##Okay, but what is '*nix', really?

Relatively short history of it and the current role it plays in today's tech environment.

##Why learn this?

Coming off of the previous discussion about the current role, note that *nix (esp. linux these days) essentially powers most of the internet. Also, if you spend any time with open source stuff, you'll inevitably end up dealing with the commandline.

##What's this open source thing and why should librarians care?

Make connections between open source/free culture and open access, as well as other librarian values.

##Let's get down to business!
