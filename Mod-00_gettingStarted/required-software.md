#Setting up your learning environment

##Linux

If you already have a \*nix operating system installed on your computer, then you can use whichever terminal emulator program you like best (the system default, or any other one), as long as you are running the BASH shell for this exercise. BASH is the default for most linux systems, so you should be fine.

[See here for a quick explanation][1]

##Apple/Mac/OSX

OSX is probably the most well-known \*nix variant (that many Apple users don't always know is a \*nix variant). For this, all you need to do is open the Terminal.app, which is often found in the 'Utilities' app folder (or you can type 'terminal' in spotlight).

##Windows

Windows is a wee bit more complicated by for this workshop, we recommend using the free [msysgit][2] program which will give you the needed bash emulation and install git for use in the later modules.

If you want something more comprehensive and that more closely emulates a *nix environment, you can download [cygwin][3], this gives you a lot more options and will create an environment with the typical linux directory structure. However, the installation is a little more involved than msysgit.

If you have access to a server running \*nix then you can download [putty][4], which will allow you to SSH into the server. Depending on the context, the instructor might provide a temporary server for Windows users to login into, if this is deemed easier. If this approach is taken, then how to login (if you don't already know) will be explained in class.
